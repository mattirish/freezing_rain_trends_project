# Scripts & Data for Great Lakes Freezing Rain Trends Project
This repo contains all the scripts used in the updated freezing rain/ice storms climatology of the Great Lakes region that I've been working on, along with the data itself.

### Data
- [a_all.mat](a_all.mat): Contains *a*, a struct containing summary data for all 98 observing stations included in the analysis
- [b.mat](b.mat): Contains *b*, a struct containg the full timeseries of freezing rain observations for all 98 stations in the analysis
- 

### Scripts
- [FZRADurationAnalysis.m](FZRADurationAnalysis.m): Analyze spatial and temporal trends in the duration of freezing rain events
- [FZRA_Changepoint_Analysis.R](FZRA_Changepoint_Analysis.R):


*Note:* all third-party MATLAB dependencies used in the project can be found at [my other repo here](https://github.com/mattirish/matlab_addons).
