# freezing_rain_trends_project
This repo contains all the scripts used in the updated freezing rain/ice storms climatology of the Great Lakes region that I've been working on, along with the data itself.

*Note:* this needs to eventually include all third-party MATLAB dependencies used in the project, which I'll add as a submodule. For now, those scripts can be found at [my other repo here](https://github.com/mattirish/matlab_addons).
